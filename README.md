# Hi, I'm Lautaro ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer, chef, hippie, hitchhiker, and nerd.
I work best in dynamic, purposeful and diligent teams, who never shy away from a challenge, where I can continue to improve my skills while building meaningful projects.

To see some of the projects I have been working on recently, see my [website](https://talingo.github.io/portfolio/)
